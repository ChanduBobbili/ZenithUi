# Theme

## Light & Dark

Choosing either `light` or `dark` explicitly applies the selected theme to the component, overriding any system preferences.

## üåó How "auto" Theme Works

When the user selects `Auto` for the theme, the following factors determine whether the app uses the light or dark theme:

1. Local Storage:

- We first check if the `theme` key in `localStorage` is set to `system` (auto mode).

2. System Preference:

- If the theme is set to auto, we check the system's preferred color scheme using:

```js
window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches
```

- If the system prefers dark mode, the theme will be `dark`. Otherwise, it will be `light`.

3. Dark Class on Body or Root:

- We also check if the `body` or `#root` element has the `dark` class.
- If either has the `dark` class, the app switches to dark mode, regardless of system preference.

4. Real-Time Updates:

- If the system theme changes while the app is open, the theme automatically updates.
- Similarly, changes to the `dark` class on the `body` or `#root` element will reflect instantly.

## üìù Example Flow

- If localStorage.theme is `system` and system prefers dark ‚Üí Theme is `dark`.
- If localStorage.theme is `system` and system prefers light ‚Üí Theme is `light`.
- If system preference is `light`, but the body has dark class ‚Üí Theme is `dark`.
