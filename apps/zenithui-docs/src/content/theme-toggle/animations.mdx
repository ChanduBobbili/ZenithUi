### Best Practices

- Keep animation duration under 800ms for responsiveness.
- Use subtle effects (like Circle or Ripple) for production apps.
- Reserve intense animations (like Glitch or Pixelate) for creative or portfolio sites.
- Always ensure accessibility â€” avoid rapid flashing or over-bright transitions.
